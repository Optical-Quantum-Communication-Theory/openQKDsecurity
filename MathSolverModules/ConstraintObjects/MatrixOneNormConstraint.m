classdef MatrixOneNormConstraint <BaseConstraint
    %MATRIXONENORMCONSTRAINT A simple class to model matrix 1-norm
    %constraints for the Hilbert space of Hermitian operators.
    % Constraints are of the form ||Phi(rho) -operator||_1 <= scalar up to
    % some error tolerance. Where the norm is the trace distance (sum of
    % singular values). The map Phi from the space X to Y is stored as its
    % Choi matrix with systems ordered as X tensor Y. This is an affine
    % transformation of a norm ball constraint which can be converted to
    % convex constraints with slack variables.
    %
    % Properties:
    % * choiMatrix: Operator that represents the hermitian preserving
    %   linear map Phi from operators on system X to  operators on system
    %   Y. We assume that the the Choi matrix orders the systems X tensor
    %   Y. dim(Y) is infered from the property, operator, and this also
    %   gives enough information to infer dim(X). To ensure dim(X) is an
    %   integer, size(choiMatrix,1) must be divisible by dim(Y). If you
    %   must change both the choiMatrix and operator, use the
    %   setChoiMatrixAndOperator method to update them simultaneously. This
    %   will prevent system dimension divisibility errors caused by updating
    %   them one at a time.
    % * operator: An operator from the Hermitian operators on system Y. It
    %   offsets the norm ball. To ensure dim(X) is an integer,
    %   size(choiMatrix,1) must be divisible by dim(Y) (size(operator,1)).
    %   If you must change both the choiMatrix and operator, use the
    %   setChoiMatrixAndOperator method to update them simultaneously. This
    %   will prevent system dimension divisibility errors caused by
    %   updating them one at a time.
    % * scalar: The real non-negative "radius" of the norm ball. It can be
    %   set to inf, though the constraint will do nothing.
    % * rhoDim: Size of the input system's Hilbert space for this
    %   constraint. (rhoDim = dim(X))
    % * operatorDim: Size of the Hermitian operator on system Y.
    %   (operatorDim = dim(Y))

            % * choiMatrix (0): Operator that represents the hermitian

            %   matrix orders the systems as X tensor Y. The size of system
            %   Y is taken from the operator and X is infered by dividing
            %   the size of the choi matrix by the size of the operator.
            % * operator (0): An operator from the hermitian operators on
            %   system Y. It offsets the norm ball. When setting the
            %   operator, the size of the new operator matrix must ensure
            %   that the size of the Choi matrix is divisible by the size
            %   of the new system Y.
