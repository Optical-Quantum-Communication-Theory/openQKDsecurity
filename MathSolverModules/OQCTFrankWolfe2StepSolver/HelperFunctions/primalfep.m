function fval = primalfep(perturbation, rho,keyProj,krausOperators,safeCutOff)
% primalfep Calculates the value $f_{\epsilon}(\rho)$, where the epsilon
% value is carefully chosen to ensure the gradient exists (use
% perturbationChannelEpsilon).
% $f_{\epsilon} = D(G_\epsilon(\rho)||Z(G_\epsilon(\rho)))$
%
% Inputs:
% * perturbation: The amount to perturb by
% * rho: The density matrix at which to calculate f
% * keyProj: Projection operators of the pinching channel acting on the key
%   register used in the solver.
% * krausOperators: Kraus operators for the G map used in calculation
% * safeCutoff: Cut-off for the logmsafe function
%
% Outputs:
% * fval: The computed value of $f_{\epsilon}(\rho)$
% * realEpsilon: The epsilon value that was used to compute fval. Must be
%   between 0 and 1.
