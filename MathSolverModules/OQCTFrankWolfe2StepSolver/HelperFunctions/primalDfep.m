function Dfval = primalDfep(perturbation, rho, keyProj, krausOperators,safeCutOff)
% primalDfep Computes the value [nabla f_epsilon(rho)], where the epsilon
% value is carefully chosen perturbation. To ensure the gradient exists
% (use perturbationChannelEpsilon). The gradient follows the numerator
% convention for matrix derivatives.
%
% Inputs:
% * perturbation: The amount to perturb by.
% * rho: The density matrix at which to calculate the value.
% * keyMap: The key map currently being used in the solver.
% * krausOperators: Kraus operators for the G map currently being used.
% * safeCutOff: Cut-off for the logmsafe function
%
% Outputs: 
% * Dfval: The value of the gradient at the given value of rho. This uses
%   numerator convention.
