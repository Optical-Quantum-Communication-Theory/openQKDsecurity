function [deltaLeak,gains] = errorCorrectionCost(announcementsA,announcementsB,jointExpectations,keyMap,fEC,reverseReconciliation)
% ERRORCORRECTIONCOST A function to help automate the calculation of the
% error correction cost ($\delta_\text{leak}$) For a broad range of
% protocols. For each pair of accepted announcements, ERRORCORRECTIONCOST
% computes the probability of giving the announcement (often refured to as
% gain), conditions the expectation values on the measurement, then applies
% the key map. For direct reconciliation, Alice sets the key and Bob
% corrects his side to it. For a given pair of announcements, alpha and
% beta, the error correction cost is given by fEC*H(R|Y,alpha,beta), where
% H() is the Shannon entropy in bits, R is the key register, Y is Bob's
% outcomes and fEC is the efficiency of error correction. The total error
% correction cost is thus the average error correction cost for all the
% accepted announcements. The gains p(alpha,beta) is also returned and is
% in the same order as the keyMap elements.
%
% Inputs:
% * announcementsA: String array of each announcement made by Alice for
%   each
%   of her measurement outcomes.
% * announcementsB: String array of each announcement made by Bob for each
%   of his measurement outcomes.
% * jointExpectations: Array of the complete joint expectations from Alice
%   and Bob's joint measurements. The array is organized by Alice's POVM
%   measurements down, and Bob's POVM measurements across. The table should
%   also be sorted such that it has a consistent order for POVM elements
%   with announcementA, announcementsB, and each keyAssignment with in the
%   keyMap. The announcements should form a valid probability distrubtion
%   (each element is non negative and sums to 1).
% * keyMap: An array of KeyMapElement objects that represents all accepted
%   announcement pairs along with an assignment (one per announcement pair)
%   to take Alice's (or Bob's for reverse) POVM measurement outcomes to the
%   key bits (or dits). Each accepted announcement pair must be an element
%   from the cartisian product of Alice and Bob's announcements. For direct
%   reconcilitation (reverse), the number of elements in each key
%   assignment must match with the number of elements in announcementsA
%   (announcementsB).
% * fEC: Error correction effiency. It 1 means we are correcting at the
%   Shannon limit. A more practicle value would be around 1.16.
% * reverseReconciliation (false): Logical value to determine if we switch
%   from direct reconciliation where Alice set the key, to reverse
%   reconciliation where Bob sets the key.
