    % the Bloch Sphere. Typically this is extended by other classes which
    % need more functionality.

        function transMat = rotateStateSphericalCoordinates(rotationAngle,thetaPolar,phiAzimuth,options)
            % A function that constructs the unitary transition matrix for
            % polarization coherent states for a rotation about an
            % arbitrary axis. The axis is specified by its polar angle from
            % the Z-axis and its azimuth in the XY-plane. By default, the
            % angle of rotation is based on rotation around the bloch
            % sphere (period of 4pi) and not a physical rotation such as a
            % physically rotating a device.
            %
            % Input:
            % * rotationAngle: Angle rotated by around the bloch sphere
            %   (period of 4pi).
            % * thetaPolar: angle for the axis of rotation from the
            %   positive Z-axis down (ie. starting from the state H). Must
            %   be in the range of 0 to pi.
            % * phiAzimuth: angle for the axis of rotation in the XY-plane.
            %   Angle starts from positive X and rotates towards positive Y
            %   (i.e. starting from the state D and rotating towards the
            %   state R).
            % Name-value arguments:
            % * angleOnBlochSphere: Default true. When true, the angle of
            %   rotation is based on rotation around the Bloch sphere
            %   (period of 4pi). When false, the rotation is viewed as a
            %   physical rotation (period of 2pi) such as physically
            %   rotating a device.
